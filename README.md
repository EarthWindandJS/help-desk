Greenfield Project

Project X: Our team's goal is to revamp Makersquare's current Help Desk application. Our solution aims to continue the tradition of having a simple UI for Help Requests (HRs). We believe that it should be easy for students to submit help requests. Fellows too should have a simple interface to manage these HRs. We balance this desire with another desire, which is to provide the Makersquare administration with useful information to compile and analyze.

Tech Stack

We use Babel to transpile ES6 and JSX code. For development purposes, we recommend using an in-browser transpiler offered by a CDN. But for production, we recommend precompiling your code prior to deploying.

Front-End:
Bootstrap
ReactJS

Back-End:
Node.js
Express
MongoDB
Mongoose (ODM)

Utilities:
Webpack -- javascript file bundling (please read this Webpack tutorial by one of React's lead engineers, Pete Hunt, espousing the benefits of Webpack within the React workflow. https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto)
Grunt / Gulp / Shell Files for ease-of-build

Further Notes:
Please .gitignore your node_modules and bower_components. We do not want to clutter our repo. This will bottleneck the download/upload processes.

Down the road, we would like to implement React-Router (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router), an npm module that synchronizes your URL with your views. This is desirable for cohesion between views, browser history, and URLs -- ultimate cohesion.

More to come later...

Sincerely,
The Witty Wombats
